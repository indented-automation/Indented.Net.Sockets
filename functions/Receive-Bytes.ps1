function Receive-Bytes {
  # .SYNOPSIS
  #   Receive bytes using a TCP or UDP socket.
  # .DESCRIPTION
  #   Receive-Bytes is used to accept inbound TCP or UDP packets as a client exepcting a response from a server, or as a server waiting for incoming connections.
  #
  #   Receive-Bytes will listen for bytes sent to broadcast addresses provided the socket has been created using EnableBroadcast.
  # .PARAMETER BufferSize
  #   The maximum buffer size used for each receive operation.
  # .PARAMETER Socket
  #   A socket created using New-Socket. If the ProtocolType is TCP the socket must be connected first.
  # .INPUTS
  #   System.Net.Sockets.Socket
  #   System.UInt32
  # .EXAMPLE
  #   C:\PS>$Socket = New-Socket
  #   C:\PS>Connect-Socket $Socket -RemoteIPAddress 10.0.0.1 -RemotePort 25
  #   C:\PS>$Bytes = Receive-Bytes $Socket
  #   C:\PS>$Bytes | ConvertTo-String
  # .EXAMPLE
  #   C:\PS>$Socket = New-Socket -ProtocolType Udp -EnableBroadcast
  #   C:\PS>$Socket | Receive-Bytes
