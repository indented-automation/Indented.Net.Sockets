function Test-UdpPort {
  # .SYNOPSIS
  #   Attempt to whether a UDP port is willing to receive packets.
  # .DESCRIPTION
  #   Test-UdpPort has a number of limitations due to the nature of UDP:
  #
  #     * UDP is a connectionless protocol, reciept of the packet by the target cannot be guaranteed (or tested remotely).
  #     * The remote server may elect to ignore the packet even if it has been received.
  #
  #   Services such as DNS and NTP will not (or are not likely to) respond to a single byte packet. If they did the potential for amplification attacks would be quite extraordinary.
  #
  #   Such limitations make this CmdLet moderately useless in a practical context without a sniffer or some other method of logging receipt of the generated packet on the target.
  # .PARAMETER ComputerName
  #   An host name or IP address for the target system.
  # .PARAMETER Port
  #   The port number to connect to (between 1 and 655535).
  # .INPUTS
  #   System.String
  #   System.UInt16
  # .OUTPUTS
  #   System.Boolean
  # .EXAMPLE
  #   Test-UdpPort 10.0.0.1 1001
  #
  #   Send a single-byte packet to the UDP service running on port 1001 on the remote server.
